# License

:>[c=red][i=fa-exclamation-triangle] Right now czResponsiveGrid is "gratis" but it is a proprietary product (with no free license). It is open source but at this moment I am not able to know which model would be the most convenient, so, for the moment, if you want to use it you will have to request your license at price 0 to me. My contact information is bellow. Please, contact me freely.
