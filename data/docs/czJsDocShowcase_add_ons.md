# Developing czJsDocShowcase Add Ons

czJsDocShowcase has an observable object that manage all communications between the modules through event broadcasts and subscriptions.

The file **../data/addOn/addon_example.js** includes the code necessary to capture events so that it allows you to interact with the system depending on what you want to do.

In that code, shown below, include:

- Subscription to some of the events to show how to capture them.
- Some commented lines of code that allow observing all the events generated by czJsDocShowcase.

This file must be included in the 'scriptsToLoad' array of the czJsDocShowcaseConfig.js file, which, in this example, has been included with comments. Find and uncomment the line that includes the file and reload the page with the Chrome developer tool open and you will be able to observe the arrival of events.

If you want to observe all the events, uncomment the commented lines of code in the constructor of the addon_example.js file.
