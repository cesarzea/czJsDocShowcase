# Developer Manual. Introduction.


This Development Manual is structured in the following sections:

- Extension of markdown syntax: allows you to redefine how the syntax of markdown files is transformed into html and allows you to define new syntax elements to extend the markdown functionality.
- Creation of czJsDocShowcase add-ons: allows you to create modules that intercept the operation of czJsDocShowcase to modify its behavior or carry out complementary actions, such as, for example, recording user navigation.
- Modification of the existing parses of the markdown or jsDoc files, or the creation of new parses.
- Creation or modification of the views that show the information.
- Modification or expansion of the internal characteristics of czJsDocShowcase.
